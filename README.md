A simple Asteroids-style arcade game. You pilot a ship in a 2D space, rotate and thrust to move, and shoot drifting asteroids. The screen shows your ship, bullets, and rocks; collisions break asteroids and can destroy the ship.

The game window starts on CLI execution of main.py. Using Pygame a game loop ticks many times per second, handling input, updating objects, and drawing to the screen. Sprites (ship, bullets, asteroids) track position/velocity, belong to groups, and interact via collision detection. Timers/frames regulate events; logging snapshots help debug state. You’ll use vectors, basic physics, state management, and modular design.

These core ideas map to any interactive system—simulation loops, event handling, real-time state updates, and logging/telemetry. I practiced data structures, OOP design, and debugging with logs—useful in game dev, robotics, UI apps, and backend services that process events continuously.
